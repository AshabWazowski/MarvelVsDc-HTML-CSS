        Superman or Kal-L is the most strongest superhero in the entire DC Comics. He has immense strength compared to
        any other superhero. An alien to earth yet he managed to conceal himself by making a secret identity of Clark
        Kent, a reporter for Daily Planet. He is the leader of Justice League alongside Batman. The duo of Superman &
        Batman is considered as the most powerful duo in the entire comics history. Superman is immune to almost
        everything made by manwhether it's a bullet or a missile or even a nuclear bomb however he has just one weakness
        revealed till now, i.e., Kryptonite, a kind of stone from the planet Krypton where he was born. Due to his
        immense power and impenetrable skin he is considered as a God among humans.
        <br>
        Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotiveâ€¦ The Man of Steel fights a never-ending battle
        for truth, justice, and the American way.

        From his blue uniform to his flowing red cape to the "S" shield on his chest, Superman is one of the most
        immediately recognizable and beloved DC Super Heroes of all time. The Man of Steel is the ultimate symbol of
        truth, justice, and hope. He is the world's first Super Hero and a guiding light to all.

        The tip of the spear in a revolution that would change the landscape of pop culture, Superman has spent the last
        eighty years redefining what it means to stand for truth, justice and the American way. The last survivor of the
        doomed planet Krypton, raised in the quiet heartland of Smallville, Kansas, Superman is as much a legend as he
        is a man: the gold standard of heroism, compassion and responsibility.

        Though his powers make him god-like next to his human compatriots, Superman's story is not one of greed or
        conquest. Instead, he strives to represent the inherent goodness of the human spirit, and the capacity of every
        living thing to do right by their neighbors.
