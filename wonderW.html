        Princess Diana of Themyscira or as we know her Wonder Woman is among the three most important members of Justice
        League along with Superman & Batman. They were the first three superheroes to be appread in DC Comics. Just like
        Superman she has also got immense strength & is considered as a Goddess. She possess a Lasso known as the Lasso
        of Truth. No one ever has escaped her lasso. She does not age like normal humans & even after her superhuman
        strength she is an expert in hand to hand combat & martial arts. She is considered as an emotional, calm,
        intelligent & a compassionate hero.</P>
        <P style="font-size: 25px; background-color: rgba(145, 137, 137, 0.788)">
        Beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, swifter than Hermes, and stronger than Hercules, Princess Diana of
        Themyscira fights for peace in Man's World.

        One of the most beloved and iconic DC Super Heroes of all time, Wonder Woman has stood for nearly eighty years
        as a symbol of truth, justice and equality to people everywhere. Raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, also
        known as Paradise Island, Diana is an Amazon, like the figures of Greek legend, and her people's gift to
        humanity.

        As Themyscira's emissary to Man's World, Diana has made it her duty to lead by example, even if the differences
        between her birthplace and new home sometimes present hurdles for her to jump. She has come to represent the
        possibility and potential of life without war, hate or violence, and she is a beacon of hope to all who find
        themselves in need. She stands as an equal among the most powerful Super Heroes, with a sense of purpose to
        protect the world from injustice in all forms.

        Diana's job, however, is anything but easy. Constantly torn between her mission to promote peace and her need to
        fight back against the pervasive violence of her new home, Diana struggles to walk a line between her warrior
        strength and endless compassion each and every day.
