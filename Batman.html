        In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on the criminals of Gotham City. He is
        vengeance. He is the night. He is Batman.

        One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a
        war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child.
        Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super
        Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of
        his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.

        A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial
        worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath
        his family’s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and
        pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.

        Batman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was created by artist
        Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30,
        1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
        philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises based in Gotham City. Kane, Finger, and future DC writers
        accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekick Robin, allies Alfred Pennyworth, James
        Gordon and Catwoman, and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, and his archenemy, the Joker.
        Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his
        parents Thomas and Martha; he trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and
        monitors the Gotham streets at night.

        Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane frequently
        claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something
        more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was originally
        introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with
        a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any
        superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series
        used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended.
        Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the
        1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.
